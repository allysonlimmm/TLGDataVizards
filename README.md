<b> About us: </b>
<p> We are a group of data enthusiasts who embarked on this journey to learn more about data visualisations and its impacts. Through these 4 weeks, we are grateful to have had one another's support, as well as the organising team's unwavering support and advice. </p>

Requirements:
* Tableau 2019.4 or newer
* Sufficient computing power on your device
    
Data:
* As our data set is too big, it is impossible to upload it onto GitHub. Please find the original dataset from here (https://www.kaggle.com/mkechinov/ecommerce-behavior-data-from-multi-category-store). We only used the '2019-Oct.csv' data as the '2019-Nov.csv' dataset is too huge.
